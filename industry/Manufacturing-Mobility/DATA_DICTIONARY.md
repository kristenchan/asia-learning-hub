## `Operations_Data`

| Column | What it means | Unit / Format | How to read it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Date | Start date of the production week | Date | — |
| Week | ISO week label | Text (e.g. `2026-W42`) | Use to compare week-over-week trends |
| Plant | Manufacturing site | Text | — |
| Line | Production line within the plant | Text | One line builds one product family |
| Product Family | Product the line builds | Text | — |
| Opening WIP Units | Work-in-progress units on the line at the start of the week | Units | Context for how loaded the line is |
| Completed Units | Good units finished in the week (throughput) | Units | ↑ Higher is better |
| Scrap Units | Units discarded because they could not be used or reworked | Units | ↓ Lower is better |
| Downtime Minutes | Minutes the line was stopped (breakdowns, waiting for material, etc.) | Minutes | ↓ Lower is better |
| On-Time Delivery % | Share of customer orders shipped on the promised date | % (stored as decimal, 0.90 = 90%) | ↑ Higher is better; below 90% is a customer risk |
| Runtime Minutes | Minutes the line actually ran | Minutes | Runtime ÷ Planned = Availability |
| Planned Minutes | Minutes the line was scheduled to run | Minutes | 480 = one 8-hour shift |
| Availability | Share of planned time the line was actually running | % | ↑ Higher is better |
| Performance | How fast the line ran compared with its ideal speed | % | ↑ Higher is better |
| Quality | Share of produced units that were good | % | ↑ Higher is better |
| OEE | **Overall Equipment Effectiveness** = Availability × Performance × Quality. The single headline score for line health | % | ↑ Higher is better; ~85% is world class, below 60% signals serious loss |
| Cycle Time Sec | Average seconds to produce one unit | Seconds | ↓ Lower is better |
| Changeover Minutes | Minutes spent switching the line between products or setups | Minutes | ↓ Lower is better |
| Estimated Gross Margin USD | Estimated gross margin the line generated in the week (a contribution, **not** a loss) | USD | ↑ Higher is better; a drop shows the financial cost of disruption |

## `Quality_and_Supplier_Risk`

| Column | What it means | Unit / Format | How to read it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Date / Week / Plant / Line / Product Family | Same keys as `Operations_Data`, used to link the two sheets | — | — |
| Supplier | Key supplier for the line | Text | Links quality problems to a source |
| Material Group | Material the supplier provides | Text | — |
| First Pass Yield Target | Target share of units that pass inspection the first time | % | Fixed at 98% |
| First Pass Yield Actual | Actual share of units that passed inspection the first time, without rework (**FPY**) | % | ↑ Higher is better; below target = quality problem |
| Scrap Rate | Scrapped units as a share of total units | % | ↓ Lower is better |
| Defect PPM | Defective parts per million units produced | Count | ↓ Lower is better |
| Customer Complaints | Complaints received from customers in the week | Count | ↓ Lower is better |
| Late PO Lines | Purchase-order lines the supplier delivered late | Count | ↓ Lower is better; drives material shortages |
| Expedite Cost USD | Extra money paid to rush late materials (e.g. air freight) | USD | ↓ Lower is better |
| Production Impact Hours | Production hours lost because of supplier issues | Hours | ↓ Lower is better |
| Containment Status | Whether defective material has been isolated so it cannot reach customers | Open / Closed | Open = issue still active |
| CAPA Status | **Corrective and Preventive Action**, the formal fix for the root cause | Open / In Progress / Closed | Closed = fix completed |
| Risk Rating | Quality team's overall risk rating for the line that week | Low / Medium / High / Critical | Critical needs leadership attention |
